When considering a physical randomness source, X is itself ultimately\nthe result of a measurement on an underlying quantum system, and the question\narises of how much classical randomness can we extract from a quantum system.\nTo understand and analyze this question, we will first provide the relevant quantum\npreliminary background, and then define quantum-to-classical (QC) and quantumto-quantum (QQ) randomness extractors. Finally, we will explore cryptographic\napplications of QC randomness extractors, such as security in the noisy-storage\nmodel, and discuss possible future applications, such as privacy amplification.",
