#### Intro:

In 2014, Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues proposed the machine learning architecture of the
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), a generative model that can produce images, text, or
music. [1] In 2016, Tim Salimans alongside Goodfellow and other OpenAI researchers responded
to the initial GAN paper with a paper on improved techniques for training GANs that discussed
methods to stabilize training and encourage convergence. [2] This research directly led to the
development of the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) and subsequent papers by Martin Arjovsky and
his colleagues. [3][4] The Wasserstein GAN aimed to reduce mode collapse and create more
stable training than the original GAN. Today, there are many interesting applications of
Wasserstein GANs including data augmentation for emotion recognition [5] and singing voice
synthesizers [6].
